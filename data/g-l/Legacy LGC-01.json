    "overview": "The Legacy was produced as a testbed for new technologies, including the Ultra AC/10 and C3i Computer.",
    "capabilities": "They upgraded its targeting system and included the C3i, which allows six units to coordinate fire. Its thick armor protection, standard fusion engine, and CASE give the Legacy remarkable staying power on the battlefield. One of the weaknesses of the 'Mech is its slow speed compared to other 'Mechs of similar size, but the inclusion of jump jets sought to counter that with superior maneuverability.",
    "deployment": "The main guns on the Legacy are its two large-bore Mydron Excel autocannon, which are capable of punching through any opposing 'Mech with amazing speed. The three Diverse Optics lasers and the Guided Technologies 2nd Gen 4-tube are clearly backup weapons. The lack of significant long-range weapons hampers the design somewhat, an absence that is only exacerbated by its slow speed. Moreover, the 'Mech's vaunted durability is limited due to its reliance on ammo-fed weaponry. Should the Legacy run out of ammunition, it is clearly advantageous for the pilot to quit the field rather than attempt to use energy weaponry that can be outclassed by 'Mechs half its size.",
    "history": "At the request of Word of Blake Precentor Martial Cameron St. Jamais. The designers used a failed Star League 'Mech called the Rising Star as the base for the Legacy.",
