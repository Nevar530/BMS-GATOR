    "overview": "The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.",
    "capabilities": "It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.",
    "deployment": "Poltergeist Precentor Sigma Tamiel of the 47th Shadow Division uses a custom weapons configuration. His Grigori mounts two Thunderbolt 10 missile launchers and a Snub-Nose PPC. A head-mounted Guardian ECM Suite provides an additional layer of defense. For increased mobility, the Grigori Tamiel carries four Jump Jets.",
    "history": "The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.",
