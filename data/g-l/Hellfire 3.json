    "overview": "Following the development of Heavy Laser technology, Clan Star Adder scientists sought a test-bed on which to mount the lasers.",
    "capabilities": "A smaller XL engine reduces this variant's top speed to 64km/h, but the MASC system allows the 'Mech to top out at 86km/h for short bursts of speed. The weaponry has been replaced: The side torsos each carry a single SRM-6, while each arm carries an ER Flamer, Flamer, and two Plasma Cannons. Fifteen double heat sinks dissipate the massive heat load generated by the weaponry.",
    "history": "For this purpose, they resurrected the Lupus, a first-generation OmniMech that had been relegated to second-line units or put into storage in Brian Caches. Seeking to rebuild the under-strength post-Burrock Absorption Star Adder touman, upon learning the heavy lasers worked so well on the Lupus, Khan Cassius N'Buta ordered more Lupuses be refitted en masse. From 3058 on, Arcadia BattleMech Plant CM-T4 had refitted over a hundred Hellfires for Clan Star Adder as well future-Snake Alliance allies Clan Cloud Cobra. Deployed in significant numbers among the Star Adders' second-line galaxies, a moderate number have fallen into the hands of other Clans who've faced the Adders. Despite its initial success, the combat service of the Hellfire has not been flaw free. Aside from the sensor interference caused by firing its signature Heavy Lasers, a number of battlefield reports indicate the heavy laser tubes can violently rupture in the heat of battle. The 'Mech also experiences a fifteen percent higher rate of MASC failure than usual, though technicians have yet to determine whether this is due to the age of the Lupus chassis or if this is something caused by the Heavy Lasers.",
