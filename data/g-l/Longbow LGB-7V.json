    "overview": "The Longbow, introduced in 2480 as the LGB-0C Longbow, has seen service in the armies of the Inner Sphere since the days of the Star League and is one of the most well-known fire support 'Mechs in existence.",
    "capabilities": "The Longbow is a massive BattleMech weighing in at 85 tons and is able to move at a top speed of 54.0 km/h, thanks to a Strand 255 fusion engine. The Longbow is protected by fourteen and a half tons of armor. Some have criticized the design for its lack of CASE - making an otherwise rugged 'Mech vulnerable to a loss by an ammunition explosion. As a fire-support 'Mech though, the Longbow is a trusted and reliable machine that can be counted on to carry out the mission it is designed for.",
    "deployment": "The 7V variant of the Longbow upgrades the design to more modern specifications. The 'Mech is powered by an XL engine that weighs half as much as the original engine. The 'Mech also removes the two LRM-5 launchers and adds Artemis IV to the LRM-20 launchers, and CASE for added protection. For close combat, the 7V has 5 Medium Pulse Lasers. To add a little more long range firepower, the 7V has also has an ER Large Laser.",
