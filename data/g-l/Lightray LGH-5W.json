    "overview": "The Lightray was designed by Martinson Armaments to be a heavy scout 'Mech and was put into production in 3064.",
    "capabilities": "The Lightray is built on a lightweight Geometric 33B Endo Steel chassis to help maximize the available weight for weapons and equipment and features a gigantic LTV 385 XL engine, the largest that can possibly be carried by a 'Mech its size. The engine allows the scout 'Mech to outpace most other medium designs with a top speed of 118 kilometers per hour, though it lacks the added maneuverability that could be provided by jump jets. The Lightray carries ten and a half tons of Strasbourg Armaments Type 4 Ferro-Fibrous armor, giving the 'Mech a great deal of protection.",
    "deployment": "Some pilots complained about the lack of long-range weaponry on the two other Lightrays, so the -5W simply replaces the Large Pulse Laser with an ER PPC.",
