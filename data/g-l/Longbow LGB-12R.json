    "overview": "The Longbow, introduced in 2480 as the LGB-0C Longbow, has seen service in the armies of the Inner Sphere since the days of the Star League and is one of the most well-known fire support 'Mechs in existence.",
    "capabilities": "The Longbow is a massive BattleMech weighing in at 85 tons and is able to move at a top speed of 54.0 km/h, thanks to a Strand 255 fusion engine. The Longbow is protected by fourteen and a half tons of armor. Some have criticized the design for its lack of CASE - making an otherwise rugged 'Mech vulnerable to a loss by an ammunition explosion. As a fire-support 'Mech though, the Longbow is a trusted and reliable machine that can be counted on to carry out the mission it is designed for.",
    "deployment": "This version of the Longbow carries a quartet of LRM-15 launchers, backed up by an ER Large Laser and ER Medium Laser. CASE protects the ammunition bins, while three jump jets allow the 12R to cover 90 meters at a time. To make room for this equipment, a Light Fusion Engine is used.",
