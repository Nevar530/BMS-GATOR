    "overview": "The Hellion is a product of Clan Ice Hellion and their philosophy that espouses speed above all else. Based on the Mist Lynx, the Hellion is a fast OmniMech that has respectable firepower.",
    "capabilities": "This light 'Mech is rather difficult to kill, incorporating five and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. To save weight, the Hellion also uses an Endo Steel chassis. While it is not especially fast for its size, the Hellion does use MASC to allow for bursts of additional speed.",
    "deployment": "The Hellion sports no fixed weapons on its chassis. The primary configuration consists of four ER Medium Lasers as well as a trio of Streak SRM-2s, which make it a potent headhunter 'Mech. It also packs an LRM-10 to harass enemies at range.",
