    "overview": "The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.",
    "capabilities": "It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.",
    "deployment": "Six Improved Jump Jets vault the Grigori D up to 180 meters. A Heavy and a Light PPC allow it to snipe effectively. Two ER Mediums and a pair of ER Smalls back up the PPCs in case an enemy gets under their minimum range.",
    "history": "The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.",
