    "overview": "The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.",
    "capabilities": "It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.",
    "deployment": "Unlike the rest of the Invictus variants of the Celestials, the Grigori's most common version is a missile-heavy 'Mech, armed with an MRM-20, LRM-15, and a Streak SRM-4. If it runs out of ammunition, the Grigori has a Light PPC and a Retractable Blade for close quarters combat. Despite the 'Mech's youth, it is already infamous for concentrating its four tons of ammunition in the right side of its torso, even though the location is protected by CASE.",
    "history": "The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.",
