    "overview": "The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.",
    "capabilities": "It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.",
    "deployment": "This variant also jumps, though it also adds a Guardian ECM Suite for further defensive measures. Three MRM 10s aim to take advantage of the integral C3 network, while twin Streak SRM-6s spreads fire out all over an enemy target. Two ER Medium Lasers back up the missile weapons in case they run out of ammunition.",
    "history": "The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.",
