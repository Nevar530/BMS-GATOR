    "overview": "The Merlin uses components that are all reliable and readily available, making the Merlin a durable and easy-to-repair 'Mech.",
    "capabilities": "The 'Mech is powered by a Pitban 240 fusion engine that gives it a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The Merlin carries ten and a half tons of armor, which is a respectable amount of protection for its weight. Additionally, the Merlin carries eighteen heat sinks to handle its heavy heat load.",
    "deployment": "The 1B variant introduced in 3053 removes the Machine Gun and its ammunition and replaces them with an additional heat sink to help handle the Merlin's heat load.",
    "history": "The Merlin debuted in 3010 as a product of the rebuilt Mountain Wolf BattleMechs. The Merlin was hailed as a technological marvel at the time it was released, as it was the first completely new design to be developed in over 100 years.",
