    "overview": "Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops.",
    "capabilities": "The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an \"anchor\" for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a \"zombie\" because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.",
    "history": "The Invictus, or primary, version of the Archangel carries a Guardian ECM Suite to allow the 'Mech to disrupt enemy electronics and targeting systems. For ranged combat, the Archangel Invictus carries a Plasma Rifle and Heavy PPC, both of which are slaved to an advanced targeting computer. The Invictus also includes jump jets, allowing the 100-tonner to hop 90 meters. Finally, a Retractable Blade gives the design added defense in close combat situations.",
