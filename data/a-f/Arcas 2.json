    "overview": "First produced in 3061, the Arcas is expensive for a second-line 'Mech.",
    "capabilities": "It utilizes an XL Engine that enables it to move up to 86 km/h and jump jets for a maximum jump capacity of one hundred fifty meters at a time. The Arcas mounts thirteen and a half tons of standard armor, the most a 'Mech of its size can carry. This variant is used primarily when far from supply lines. It removes the missiles and ER Large Lasers for a pair of ER PPCs and additional double heat sinks.",
    "history": "Following the move of Clan Ghost Bear to the Inner Sphere, Khan Bjorn Jorgensson ordered the creation of a new BattleMech. The Arcas was designed as a symbol to mark the beginning of a new era, so Loremaster Laurie Tseng named it after a character in the mythology of the Greeks who eventually became the constellation known as Ursa Minor.",
