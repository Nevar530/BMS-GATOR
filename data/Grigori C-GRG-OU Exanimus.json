    "overview": "The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.",
    "capabilities": "It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.",
    "deployment": "The Exanimus configuration is designed to defend underwater locations. Equipped with a quartet of UMUs, it can travel at approximately 46km/h underwater. The use of a MASS allows support forces to rescue the pilot in case of a hull breach. Unlike most designs intended for underwater combat, the armament of the Exanimus lacks torpedoes. Instead it carries a Heavy PPC, ER PPC, a pair of ER Medium Lasers and a pair of ER Small Lasers. To ensure it finds enemy forces early, it also carries a Beagle Active Probe.",
    "history": "The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.",
