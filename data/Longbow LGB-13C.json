    "overview": "The Longbow, introduced in 2480 as the LGB-0C Longbow, has seen service in the armies of the Inner Sphere since the days of the Star League and is one of the most well-known fire support 'Mechs in existence.",
    "capabilities": "The Longbow is a massive BattleMech weighing in at 85 tons and is able to move at a top speed of 54.0 km/h, thanks to a Strand 255 fusion engine. The Longbow is protected by fourteen and a half tons of armor. Some have criticized the design for its lack of CASE - making an otherwise rugged 'Mech vulnerable to a loss by an ammunition explosion. As a fire-support 'Mech though, the Longbow is a trusted and reliable machine that can be counted on to carry out the mission it is designed for.",
    "deployment": "This upgrade of the 12C mounts six Doombud MML 7s, each of which is tied to an Artemis IV FCS. Six tons of CASE-protected ammunition supply these launchers. Three Diverse Optics ER Small Lasers provide paltry backup, though massed short-range missiles coming from the Multi-Missile Launchers are sure to deter smaller 'Mechs. A larger engine brings the 13C to a speed that matches that of the OW.",
