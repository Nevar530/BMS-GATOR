    "overview": "The Titan II is a BattleMech produced by Kressly WarWorks on Epsilon Eridani for the Word of Blake's Protectorate Militia.",
    "capabilities": "Like the original, the Titan II has a top speed of 54 km/h and nineteen tons of standard armor. Since the 'Mech is produced for the Blakists' garrison forces, it makes no use of expensive, weight-saving technologies. It also lacks the advanced electronics that have become the hallmark of Word military forces.",
    "deployment": "A newer weapon configuration, the 2PA is designed for work against domestic insurgents. It has a pair of Plasma Rifles, four Medium Lasers, retains the Streak SRM launcher, and mounts two Machine Gun Arrays, each with four Machine Guns. It can also utilize a Beagle Active Probe to find hidden units.",
    "history": "First identified by the Successor States in 3071, the Titan II owes its existence to the Titan, a prototype that dates to 2765. That design was unearthed by the Federated Suns in 3023 and led to the Grand Titan. That design deviated significantly from the original, while the Titan II is more of an upgrade using new weaponry.",
