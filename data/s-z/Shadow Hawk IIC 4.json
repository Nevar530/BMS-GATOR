    "overview": "The Shadow Hawk IIC is a second-line Clan BattleMech based upon the Shadow Hawk that was first fielded by the Star League.",
    "capabilities": "The inexpensive unit is protected by seven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, mounted on a weight-saving Endo Steel chassis. This medium 'Mech can reach a respectable top speed of 97 km/h, though it also carries enough jump jets to vault up to 180 meters at a time.",
    "deployment": "First fielded in 3060, the IIC 4 was a joint effort by Clan Nova Cat and Clan Diamond Shark to upgrade their second-line forces. The result was a 'Mech that is visually very different from the design it is considered a variant of. This 'Mech carries a Type 6 Series ATM System with three tons of ammunition to allow for flexibility of choice. The missile launcher is backed up by two Series 14NC Medium Pulse Lasers and a Series 2NC ER Medium Laser.",
