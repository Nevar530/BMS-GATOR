    "overview": "The Clan's interpretation on the classic Warhammer has never been subtle. The BattleMech's hyper-advanced technology only emphasized and improved its duty as a frontline brawler; boosting its mass by 10 tons (with equivalent increases in armor protection) made it even more powerful.",
    "capabilities": "Thanks to their technological expertise, they were able to add ten tons with the same speed and firepower and nearly double the armor of the original. The Warhammer IIC is built on an Endo Steel frame and is protected by tons of ferro-fibrous armor. The result is a dangerous 'Mech, able to hold its own in any battle against the Inner Sphere. Also note that the armor was the primary concern when designing the IIC version rivaling even 100 ton assault 'Mechs in durability and protection.",
    "deployment": "The IIC 3 was not well-received by the Clan's buyers, so they went back to the drawing board and devoted a significant amount of energy and resources to this variant. Almost completely reworked from the ground up, the IIC 4 has a different aesthetic from the original, but its communication systems and weapons have been upgraded to top-of-the-line models, unlike the traditional view of second-line 'Mechs. The old ER PPCs were swapped out for a pair of new Type DDS \"Kingston\" models, while the secondary weapons were stripped out. They were replaced by a pair of System 4 ATM-6 launchers and a Series 1 Mk. III ER Small Laser. This variant is also the Reseen Warhammer IIC.",
    "history": "The Warhammer IIC is now the most common Clan BattleMech in the Inner Sphere. These remarkable machines are fielded by every major Inner Sphere force, Clan, and many large mercenary groups. It is only found on the periphery, where its equally outstanding price tag is simply too high for these countries to justify.",
