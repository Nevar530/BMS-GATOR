    "overview": "The Templar III is a Dark Age era Assault Class OmniMech, first produced by General Motors for the Federated Suns. It was intended as a replacement for the original Templar, whose factory lines were destroyed during the Jihad. General Motors established a new production line on New Valencia for what was to become the next generation of the Templar with newer technologies.",
    "capabilities": "Like its predecessor, the Templar III is typically utilized as a Command 'Mech by AFFS forces. With its alternate configurations the 'Mech is able to handle various combat situations thanks to access to Advanced equipment.",
    "deployment": "An Advanced Tech configuration, the weapons arrangement includes a side torso–mounted ER PPC, with six Small X-Pulse Lasers. Additionally, the B Configuration is intended for close-range combat with melee weapons, and four Jump Jets for improved mobility. Its melee weapons are a right arm–mounted Hatchet, while the left arm carries a Chain Whip. To help it get to its intended target quickly, the 'Mech is fitted with a Supercharger.",
    "history": "Among the most noticeable differences when comparing the original Templar to the Templar III is its smaller Pod Capacity. The new 'Mech has a 29 ton Pod capacity in comparison to the old Templar's 40 tons. However, the 'Mech's heavier Light Engine provides improved durability while retaining the original design's maximum speed and armor protection.",
