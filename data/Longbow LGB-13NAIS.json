    "overview": "The Longbow, introduced in 2480 as the LGB-0C Longbow, has seen service in the armies of the Inner Sphere since the days of the Star League and is one of the most well-known fire support 'Mechs in existence.",
    "capabilities": "The Longbow is a massive BattleMech weighing in at 85 tons and is able to move at a top speed of 54.0 km/h, thanks to a Strand 255 fusion engine. The Longbow is protected by fourteen and a half tons of armor. Some have criticized the design for its lack of CASE - making an otherwise rugged 'Mech vulnerable to a loss by an ammunition explosion. As a fire-support 'Mech though, the Longbow is a trusted and reliable machine that can be counted on to carry out the mission it is designed for.",
    "deployment": "This variant removes all missile launchers from the Longbow and uses a standard Fusion Engine, though it does use an Endo Steel frame to save weight. Each arm mounts three Light Autocannon/5s that can make use of special munitions produced by the Federated Suns. To ensure that it can mount such ammunition, seven tons are allotted to the ammunition bins. A Guardian ECM Suite protects it from enemy electronics, while a C3 Slave uses targeting data from other C3 equipped units to improve its accuracy. The 13NAIS mounts on ER Small Laser and a pair of ER Medium Lasers, along with a pair of B-Pods for use against battle armor.",
