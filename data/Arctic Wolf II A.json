    "overview": "The Arctic Wolf II is a Clan Wolf-in-Exile Medium OmniMech that was developed during the Jihad, and finally deployed in 3085.",
    "capabilities": "The design is based on the OmniMech variant of the original Arctic Wolf. The original OmniMech version had a number of problems, including technical glitches and a lack of speed. The Arctic Wolf II addresses speed concerns by using the original Arctic Wolf's Light Force 280 rated XL Fusion Engine. Seven Grandthrust Mk. 4 Jump Jets were also installed to increase the Mech's tactical options and exploit capabilities that were gained from the failed OmniMech J Configuration. The 'Mech has over 14 tons of pod space available for its techs to install weapons and equipment. Perhaps one of the Arctic Wolf II's only weaknesses is its light armor protection, boasting only 6.5 ton of Ferro Fibrous armor.",
    "deployment": "Tailored to short-range engagements, the A configuration consists of four Streak SRM-4 launchers mounted in both arms and side torsos with two tons of ammunition to supply all four launchers. For backup weaponry, the 'Mech sports a pair of small pulse lasers mounted in the right torso. This configuration also features an active probe and an ECM suite, with one double heat sink removed to make room for the additional equipment.",
