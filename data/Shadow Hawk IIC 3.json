    "overview": "The Shadow Hawk IIC is a second-line Clan BattleMech based upon the Shadow Hawk that was first fielded by the Star League.",
    "capabilities": "The inexpensive unit is protected by seven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, mounted on a weight-saving Endo Steel chassis. This medium 'Mech can reach a respectable top speed of 97 km/h, though it also carries enough jump jets to vault up to 180 meters at a time.",
    "deployment": "A newer variant that dates to the late 3050s, the IIC 3's main gun is a Heavy Large Laser. It is supplemented by a Medium Pulse Laser. For use against infantry, the 'Mech carries paired ER Micro Lasers and Micro Pulse Lasers. Four additional double heat sinks keep down the heat generated by the all-laser complement.",
