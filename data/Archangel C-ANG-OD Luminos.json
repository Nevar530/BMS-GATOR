    "overview": "Debuting in 3069, the Celestial series of OmniMechs are engineered to be used by the elite Word of Blake Manei Domini troops.",
    "capabilities": "The Archangel is the largest of these. Designed to be an \"anchor\" for Word formations, the 'Mech is known as a \"zombie\" because of its ability to take extreme amounts of damage and continue operating. The Archangel features a compact fusion engine, compact gyro, a small cockpit, and nineteen and a half tons of standard armor, which frees up a large amount of internal space, while an Endo Steel frame opens up free tonnage, making heavier components possible. A C3i Computer helps direct and coordinate fire.",
    "history": "Meant for work at longer ranges than the previous variants, the main guns of the Luminos are a pair of ER PPCs. Jump jets give it the ability to maneuver to a good position to snipe from more quickly, while a Guardian ECM Suite provides added defense. In case an enemy gets close, the Archangel D can utilize four Medium Pulse Lasers, an ER Small Laser, and a Small Pulse Laser that is devastating to unarmored infantry.",
