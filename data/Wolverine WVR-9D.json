    "overview": "The Wolverine commonly served as a heavy scout unit. Often deployed in situations where heavy opposition could easily destroy lighter BattleMechs, it has had a reliable service record ever since its initial deployment within the Star League Defense Force. With respectable armor, speed, and firepower, it can easily outfight lighter enemy scouts and defend itself capably if ambushed.",
    "capabilities": "The autocannon, missile system and laser found on most Wolverines are all reliable and well-storied systems. Unfortunately, the jump jets suffer from an opposing reputation; the Northrup 12000's are underpowered and prone to breakdowns. The one defining system to be found on the Wolverine, however, are its superb Tek BattleCom and Garret T11-b communications systems. The comgear, regardless of the manufacturer, is well-shielded and features a multi-channel transmitter and receiver, making the Wolverine a powerful Command BattleMech for scouting formations.",
    "deployment": "The 9D Wolverine is the companion of the 8D and shares some similarities, such as the Endo Steel chassis and the XL engine. First fielded at the same time as the 8D the 'Mech carries, as its main weapon, a Rotary Autocannon/2 backed up by two medium pulse lasers and a Streak SRM-6 launcher. It also carries a TAG laser designator, to designate targets for Arrow IV artillery attacks. Unlike the 8D, this variant does not jump, though it does retain the MASC and has twelve double heat sinks.",
    "history": "A widespread part of every major military, the Wolverine has manufacturing plants scattered throughout the entire Inner Sphere. While certain states-notably the Free Worlds League-have larger numbers of the design, only the Capellans began facing a shortage of the Wolverine after the loss of their Nanking facilities.",
