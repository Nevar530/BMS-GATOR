    "overview": "The Phantom was pushed into production by Khan Phelan Ward shortly before the Refusal War between Clan Wolf and Clan Jade Falcon, designed around Khan Ward's extensive experience with Inner Sphere tactics.",
    "capabilities": "Intended to push a medium reconnaissance 'Mech to the most extreme limits, the Phantom is built on a lightweight Type-A Endo Steel chassis and is propelled to a top speed of 151.2 km/h by a Light Force 360 XL Engine. The Phantom also boasts strong protection for its size with six tons of Composite A-2 Ferro-Fibrous armor.",
    "deployment": "Another close combat configuration, the Phantom C carries eight ER Small Lasers and a single ER Medium Laser all of which are linked to an advanced Targeting Computer for increased accuracy. The 'Mech also has a Flamer, which it can use for anti-infantry use.",
    "history": "After the Wars of Reaving, the Phantom replaced the Fire Moth Omnimech for the remaining Home Clans because of its similar role and heavier profile.",
